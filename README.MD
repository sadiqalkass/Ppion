# 🏓 Ppion Game (Customized)

This is a **two-player Ping-Pong Game** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The base version was created by following an online tutorial (author unknown), and I extended it with custom features to enhance the gameplay.

## ✨ Features
- Two-player gameplay  
  - Player 1 controls: **Up / Down Arrow keys**  
  - Player 2 controls: **W / S keys**  
- Pause and resume functionality  
- Restart option to reset the game  
- Simple and responsive design  

## 🕹️ How to Play
1. Open the game in your browser.  
2. Player 1 uses the **↑ and ↓** keys to move their paddle.  
3. Player 2 uses the **W and S** keys to move their paddle.  
4. The ball bounces off the paddles and walls — don’t let it pass your side!  
5. Use **Pause** to take a break and **Restart** to start fresh.  

## 🚀 Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ping-pong-game.git
Open index.html in your browser.
